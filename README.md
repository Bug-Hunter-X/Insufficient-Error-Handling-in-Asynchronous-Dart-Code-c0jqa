# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: insufficient error handling.  The example shows how to improve error handling to make your code more resilient.

## Bug Description

The provided `fetchData()` function demonstrates a basic asynchronous HTTP request. While it has a `try-catch` block, it only prints any errors to the console. This is inadequate for production code, as it provides no mechanism for the calling function to react to the error.

## Solution

The solution offers improved error handling by returning a `Result<T>` object. This approach allows more robust error handling and better management of the asynchronous operation's outcome.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the example using a Dart VM.
3. Observe the output to see the difference between the original flawed code and the improved solution.
